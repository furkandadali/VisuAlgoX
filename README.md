# VisuAlgoX 🎮📊

**VisuAlgoX** is an interactive Unity-based application designed to revolutionize the way developers learn **System Design** and **Data Structures & Algorithms** through **visualization**, **simulation**, and **hands-on experimentation**.

> "Because seeing is understanding."

## 🚀 What is VisuAlgoX?

VisuAlgoX blends the power of game development (Unity) with the depth of computer science fundamentals. Instead of reading abstract theory, users **experience** how algorithms and system components work — visually and interactively.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- 📈 **Visual Algorithm Simulations** (Sorting, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- 🏗 **System Design Blueprints** (e.g., Parking Lot, Elevator System)
- 🔄 Step-by-step execution & debugging
- 🧩 Modular architecture for adding new DSA/system modules
- 🎓 Perfect for interview prep (SDE, FAANG-level)

---

## 👨‍💻 Built For

- Software engineers preparing for system design & DSA interviews
- Students seeking a more intuitive way to learn CS fundamentals
- Anyone who learns best by *seeing, interacting,* and *doing*

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Unity** (C#)
- Custom algorithms + system design modules
- Extendable with new interactive components

---

## 📅 Roadmap Highlights

- [ ] Interactive Sorting Visualizer
- [ ] System Design: Scalable Chat App
- [ ] Data Structures: Trees, HashMaps, Graphs
- [ ] Design Pattern Playgrounds (Strategy, Observer, etc.)
